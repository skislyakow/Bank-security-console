# Bank security console

This is an internal repository for Siyanie Bank employees. If you've accessed this repository by accident, you won't be able to run it because you don't have access to the database. However, you can freely use the markup code or view how the database queries are implemented.

The Security Console is a website that can be connected to a remote database containing visits and access cards for our bank's employees.
